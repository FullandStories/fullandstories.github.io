      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        A dessert cafÃ© called FULL & STORIES was founded in 2024 and is situated next to Kuala
        Lumpur's National Mosque (Masjid Negara). The cafÃ© was established to provide a place where
        people could spend time together and savour locally made drinks and pastries. The concept that
        patrons depart not only stuffed with food but also with heartfelt tales and memories of time
        spent together is reflected in the name.</p>
      <p>
        The cafÃ© offers a menu with six speciality desserts and six distinctive drinks that are expertly
        made to accommodate a variety of palates. Located in a popular and serene neighbourhood,
        FULL & STORIES draws residents, students, and visitors seeking a serene and friendly
        atmosphere. The company keeps expanding by fusing high-quality goods with memorable and
        captivating consumer experiences.

  <h2>Strength and Weakness</h2>
  <div class="mv-content">
    <div>
      <h3>Strength</h3>
      <p>
        A steady stream of tourists, students, and working professionals are drawn to FULL & STORIES by its advantageous and distinctive position next to Masjid Negara. The cafÃ©'s branding emphasises storytelling and emotional connection to establish a distinctive identity that sets it apart from rivals. The establishment provides a memorable and marketable experience with its range of handcrafted, premium, and aesthetically pleasing desserts and beverages. FULL & STORIES is also ideally suited for social media engagement and promotion due to the visual appeal of the items and cafÃ© atmosphere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Weakness</h3>
      <p>
        Being a new company, FULL & STORIES still has trouble building a devoted clientele and a strong brand. Due to its small seating area, the cafÃ© may have a lower client turnover rate during peak hours. Operations may also be strained by a small team structure, particularly during busy periods. Additionally, its customer base is restricted to walk-ins due to the lack of a specialised delivery system.
